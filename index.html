        <p>My name is Julia Fang. I'm a second-year graphic design student with a passion for typography and branding.</p>

        <p>As a first-generation student, I'm motivated and determined to succeed, and pride myself on my work ethic and attention to detail. Every design problem has a solution, and I'm eager to apply my creative approach within guidelines to produce the best results that meet clients' needs. My personable nature and curious mind with a willingness to learn help define me as a strong team player.</p>
